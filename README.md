# Figma Template

This is my first professional project I'm making for Microverse.

https://ivaan1992.github.io/Figma-Template/

This project consists in cloning a Figma template. 

This was the template I choosed:
<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=23%3A9">Figma Template</a>

I cloned Mobile and Desktop version of this template. 

<b><h3>Mobile Version 📱</h3></b>

To cloning Mobile Version from this template I followed these steps: 

- Add some icons in the header section which includes some rhombuses and the hamburguer icon menu. 

- Write my name and some description of the experience. 

- Add a contact button. 

- Add design images to the template.
